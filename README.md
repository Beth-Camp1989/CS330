What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project helped me learn to create 2D and 3D scenes, apply texturing , camera movement, and lighting, and ,overall, create a realistic world for users to explore. I had no experience with creating scenes before this     class and learned so much along the way. Spatial awareness was developed so I could understand how the objects mesh and interact with each other. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
  The first step was to determine the scene and define the scope and requirements. Objects needed to be identified and a plan laid out of what shapes will create these objects. During the conceptual design phase, I wanted     the scene to look realistic and appealing so the next phase involved considering the size, position, and orientation of the objects.  The technical design phase involved making decisions about textures and lighting.         Implentation phase consisted of translating the design into code, loading and position the 3D models, and setting up lighting and shading. Throughout the process, I ran debugging and tested multiple areas of code. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  Realizing how all the little details came together to create this scene allowed me to see I need to pay more attention to detail in my future work. Little aspects, that may seem insignificant to me, create a whole new       world for the user. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  Agile methodology was used. The project was broken down into smaller tasks and worked on. Iterative development allowed me to enhance and refine different aspects of the scene, such as lighting and texture. I also used      continuos integration and continuos deployment. Since the code was so large, it was much easier to integrate bits and pieces to see the effects it had on the scene. 
  
How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration allowed me the chance to enhance my scene. Lighting was adjusted to reflect off the notebook page. Textures were changed to make the scene look more realisitic. I started off with a basic desk scene and built my   code each week to create the best scene I possibly could. 
  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My approach to developp the code went from me forcing myself to sit down for hours on end with no breaks to allowing myself time to step away from the project. I did a ton of research and ultimately got a tutor to go over   the areas I struggled in. This project made me see that asking for help is not a bad thing and that I have people I can ask for more clarification. 
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science is the backbone of my ultimate goal of becoming a software engineer. These classes and tasks will help me create better products for clients and lead to me creting a more technology-friendly world for       future generations.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualizations allowed me to see that I can persevere through the most tedious tasks. These skills learned have taught me so much more about the coding languages and will help me grow in my        future classes. 
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Computational graphics and visualizations allowed me to see the endless possibilities with code and where errors can occur. I learned throughout the process that error handling for each major task is neccessary and that   I need to pace myself. This will allow me to grow more as a student and engineer.
